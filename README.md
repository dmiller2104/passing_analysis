# EURO 2020: England passing analysis

This script explores the passing patterns and distribution of England's EURO 2020 campaign.

In the first instance this will look at the average player position in each game. In the cases of substitutions, they will be assumed to have taken the position of the player they replaced and the average player position will be based on the averages of the two players. If this does not work, because they have moved to another position, another solution will be found. 

The analysis will be communicated through data visualisation. The size of a player dot, in their average position, will be denoted by the number of passes they played, proportionate to the number of passes the entire team played. Therefore, players which play a lot of passes will have a larger dot compared to those which do not. Additionally, passes between players will also be denoted, with the most frequented connections having a larger connection, compared to those down less frequently. This is to identify common partnerships and sort after passing routes. For example, with a team that likes to play out from the back we would expect the goalkeeper to have frequented passes to the defence, with fewer passes to players further up the pitch.

These methods are based on those used by David Sumpeter in his book "Soccermatics".
